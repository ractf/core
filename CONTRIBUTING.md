## How to contribute to RACTF

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in RACTF**, and instead to refer to our [security policy](https://github.com/ractf/core/security/policy).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/ractf/core/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/ractf/core/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of RACTF will generally not be accepted (read more about [our rationales behind this decision](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/13771#issuecomment-32746700)).

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [RACTF Discord](https://discord.gg/gsdH39K) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use RACTF in the [RACTF Discord](https://discord.gg/gsdH39K).

RACTF is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and join [the team](https://github.com/ractf/core/graphs/contributors)!
